                <h3 class="information_text">Oneriri Station is committed to protecting and fostering the growth of indigenous forest, fauna and birdlife on the Peninsula. Oneriri Station is a member of the Oneriri Peninsula Landcare Group, a partnership between the four landowners that occupy the Peninsula and the Northland Regional Council. The objective is to create safe and sustainable indigenous forests that will allow native species of flora, fauna and birds to flourish. To this end a successful pest control program was completed in November 2005 to reduce numbers of possums, rats, cats and mustelids to very low levels. A dramatic improvement in forest new growth is evident along with higher levels of bird sightings.
